## Description
This Social Network API was created from scratch using MongoDB, Mongoose, and ExpressJS. Users can utilize this app to create accounts with validated usernames and emails, add other users as friends, and post thoughts and reactions to other users' thoughts. The front end platform allows users to update and delete thoughts as well as add/delete friends.
